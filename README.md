# Communicate-Data-Findings
This is the third project to complete the advanced data analysis nanodegree program by Udacity.

# PISA data to analyze## Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy. The dataset can be found in (https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/datavisualizationcontest.htm), , with feature documentation available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud507/pisadict2012.csv.).## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that Non-OECD contries representation in the data is less. I found the break down of the participants are unbalanced. Roughly half of students covered by the survey are participating from Europe and less than 1% from Africa. Also, the data represets males and females equally. As exprcted, BirthMonth is uniformally distributed with feb. slightly less as it is shortest. Most of students have internet access. The InternationalGrade is normally distributed with mode of 10. A quick investigation of the numeric variables reveal a correlation between the wealth and the index of economics social cultural status. I found consistent increase of wealth mode with grades except for the highest grade that is coresponding to the least wealthy people and the latest distribution is tight, the best academid performance is associated with the least wealthy. ## Key Insights for Presentation

, I focus on how the survey is covering the different countries. I start by plottind the continents shares, followed by the job status of fathers, then plot the wealth distribution with the students grades. 

Afterwards, I introduce some of the categorical variables one by one. Using count plot to see if Non-OECD contries has internet access as OECD contries. Then used histogram to see the distribution of wealth in each set of countries. I am using point plots for the multivariate investigations. For one of these plots, I've changed the color from the exploratory repot to make it clearer and causes less eye-strain.
